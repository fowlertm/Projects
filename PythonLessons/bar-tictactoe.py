# --REQUIREMENTS--
# Create a TicTacToe class with a data structure for your board with initial values, and create a
# method to pretty print the the board.

# Now create a method to start the game, that carries out a basic game loop (asks the user for input # to make a move, and then responds with the computerâ€™s move^). For the moment, have the computer 
# make any random move, and print the board after each move.

# Implement validation for user moves, so that impossible moves are not accepted.

# Implement an AI using a brute force.

# Implement an AI using a standard algorithm / tree data structure.

# Implement an AI using Keras/Tensorflow
